            <h3>Who We Are</h3>
            <p>Clay County STEM Alliance Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring every student has access to high-quality STEM education opportunities regardless of family financial circumstances or geographic location.</p>

            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>The Clay County STEM Alliance was founded in Clay County, Florida in August 2025. The organization was born from an urgent need when budget constraints within school districts began threatening robotics teams and STEM clubs. Rather than watch talented students lose access to programs that could shape their career trajectories, concerned parents, educators, and community leaders came together to create a sustainable solution.</p>

            <p>We saw firsthand how STEM programs transform lives. Students who had found their passion in robotics and coding faced losing these opportunities due to funding cuts. Teams that had competed at state and national levels were at risk of disbanding. We knew we had to act.</p>

            <h3>Why "Clay County" in Our Name</h3>
            <p>Our organization was incorporated in Clay County, Florida, where our founding members live and where our first team launched in Fall 2025. The name reflects our origin and home base, not limitations on who we serve.</p>
            <p><strong>We support students anywhere in the United States who need STEM education opportunities.</strong> Whether you're in Clay County, across Florida, or anywhere in the United States, if you need support for STEM programs, we're here to help.</p>

            <h3>Current Operations (Fall 2025)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Students served:</strong> 12 (11 Clay County, FL; 1 Duval County, FL)</li>
                <li><strong>Primary location:</strong> Middleburg/Orange Park area, Florida</li>
                <li><strong>Service area:</strong> Nationwide - any student can participate</li>
                <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Northeast Florida, with capability to support teams anywhere</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>What Makes Us Different</h3>
            
            <h4>Student-Led Learning</h4>
            <p>Students make strategic and operational decisions within their teams, with adult mentors providing guidance rather than direction. This isn't about adults running programs for kids—it's about empowering young people to lead, make decisions, and own their success.</p>

            <h4>Complete Financial Transparency</h4>
            <p>All financial records are open to public inspection with quarterly reporting. We believe in complete accountability to our donors, partners, and the community. You can see exactly where every dollar goes.</p>

            <h4>All-Volunteer Operation</h4>
            <p>Zero paid staff positions; 100% of donated funds go directly to student programs. Our board members and volunteers donate their time because they believe in the mission, ensuring maximum impact from every contribution.</p>

            <h4>Accessibility First</h4>
            <p>Programs designed to be free or low-cost for all participating students. No family should have to choose between STEM opportunities and household expenses. We remove financial barriers so talent and interest—not income—determine who participates.</p>

            <h4>No Geographic Boundaries</h4>
            <p>We support students anywhere in America. While we're based in Northeast Florida, our model allows us to support satellite teams, provide remote mentoring, and share resources with students across the country.</p>

            <h4>Career Support & Opportunities</h4>
            <p>We actively work to connect students with internship opportunities and scholarship resources. STEM education should lead to STEM careers, and we help make those connections:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Internship Partnerships:</strong> Working with local businesses, tech companies, and engineering firms to create opportunities for student interns</li>
                <li><strong>Scholarship Guidance:</strong> Helping students identify and apply for STEM-specific scholarships at local, state, and national levels</li>
                <li><strong>Professional Networks:</strong> Connecting students with mentors in their fields of interest</li>
                <li><strong>College Application Support:</strong> Assistance showcasing STEM achievements for college admissions</li>
                <li><strong>Portfolio Development:</strong> Helping students document their projects and skills for internship and job applications</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Our Service Model</h3>
            <p>We operate in three ways to maximize our reach and impact:</p>

            <h4>1. Direct In-Person Teams</h4>
            <p>Currently serving Northeast Florida students with hands-on programs at our physical location. Students have full access to equipment, workshops, and mentors for robotics, programming, maker projects, and more.</p>

            <h4>2. Satellite Teams</h4>
            <p>Supporting teams in other communities with our organizational infrastructure. Teams meeting in their own locations can use our 501(c)(3) status for fundraising, access our bulk purchasing, receive remote mentoring, and benefit from shared resources while maintaining their local identity.</p>

            <h4>3. Remote Support</h4>
            <p>Providing mentoring and resources for students anywhere through virtual meetings, online resources, cloud computing access, and programming support. Distance is no longer a barrier to STEM education.</p>

            <h3>Our Core Commitments</h3>
            <ul>
