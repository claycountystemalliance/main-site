                    <p>Clay County STEM Alliance Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization dedicated to ensuring every student has access to high-quality STEM education opportunities regardless of family financial circumstances or geographic location.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Clay County STEM Alliance was founded in Clay County, Florida in August 2025. The organization was born from an urgent need when budget constraints within school districts began threatening robotics teams and STEM clubs. Rather than watch talented students lose access to programs that could shape their career trajectories, concerned parents, educators, and community leaders came together to create a sustainable solution.</p>

                    <h4>Why "Clay County" in Our Name</h4>
                    <p>Our organization was incorporated in Clay County, Florida, where our founding members live and where our first team launched in Fall 2025. The name reflects our origin and home base, not limitations on who we serve. <strong>We support students anywhere in the United States who need STEM education opportunities.</strong></p>

                    <h4>Current Operations (Fall 2025)</h4>
